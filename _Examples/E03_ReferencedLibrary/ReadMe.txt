Project E03_ReferencedLibrary references library Lang.Php.Mpdf. 
Lang.Php.Mpdf is 100% written in PHP and Lang.Php.Mpdf is only facade.

How to use this example?
1. Make sure that CS2PHP solution is compiled in RELEASE mode. 
   We need following files
   a) Lang.Cs2Php\bin\Release\cs2php.exe
   b) Extensions\Lang.Php.Mpdf\bin\Release\Lang.Php.Mpdf.dll 
2. Run compile.bat
   Two projects will be compiled
   a) Lang.Php.Mpdf.csproj - in this case complete php package will be downloaded an installed instead of translation c# to PHP.
   b) E03_ReferencedLibrary.csproj
3. Look into _ExamplesOut\E03_ReferencedLibrary folder and see results
